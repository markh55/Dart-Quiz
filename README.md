## Colour Scheme

![Dart-Quiz colour scheme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09fd3fb1-2914-4adc-abd0-c0459cd10781)


I picked this scheme as i feel the colours compliment each other while still being easy on the eye and readable for the user.

* Background colour - #227C9D
* Headings #EFF1F3
* Game Area #EFF1F3
* Text within Game Area #227C9D


## Deployment

### Repository
  
I made a public local repository on my Github account, I then linked my repository to my VSCode account and started building.
When writing my code I ensured that I committed my changes to the repository using clear and direct messages for any changes,this is done by doing the following in the terminal;

  
* git add . 
* git commit -m “Enter message here” 
* git push
  
I would send a commit after each change then I would push the file once i made 3 or 4 changes.


### Hosting

This is how I hosted my website: On Github I Selected my Dart-Quiz Repository, then go to;
* Settings
* Pages

Once on the pages site I would ensure the following settings were applied;
	Source would need to be set to ‘Deploy from branch’
	Branch will need to be set to main and then root. 
	Save.
